## 🚀 What is OBS-Atom?

> **“Lightweight streaming power for legacy machines, reimagined for older hardware & autotune for anything new out there now.”**

**OBS-Atom** is a slimmed-down, performance-optimized fork of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) designed for low-spec systems like the Acer Aspire One (Intel Atom, 2GB RAM). It breathes new life into older hardware while still giving you modern streaming capabilities.

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ **Optimized for Atom CPUs** – stripped down, lightweight, and stable  
- 🎨 **Custom Themes** – including the elegant **Black & Gold Royal Theme**  
- 🔊 **Audio Enhancements** – noise suppression enabled by default  
- 📡 **Multi-Platform Streaming** – Twitch, YouTube, and more  
- 🔧 **Adaptive Performance** – auto-detects system specs to unlock features
- 🎥 Smooth streaming to **YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, TikTok** at **720p / 30fps**  
- 🖥️ **Tray integration**, **auto-tune setup**, **portable builds**  
- 🔒 **Signed packages & certificates** for trusted installs  

> OBS-Atom is more than streaming software — it’s a **creative ecosystem**. We’re building the **next-generation content engine** where creators can:

- 🎥 **Stream in Vertical Mode (9:16)** optimized for mobile-first audiences  
- 🕹 **Interactive Overlays** (polls, Q&A, countdowns)  
- ✨ **AR Filters & Effects** (open-source, real-time, TikTok-level creative power)  
- 🎶 **Trending Sounds & Music** (licensed + community-driven)  
- 💎 **Monetization Built-In** (virtual gifts, affiliate links, paid interactions)  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Suggestions** (real-time filter, effect & sound recommendations)  

> This isn’t just software — it’s a movement toward **creator ownership**, **freedom**, and **future-ready innovation**.
