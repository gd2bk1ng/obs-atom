**Built for the creators of today — and the legends of tomorrow.**
The first **fully decentralized, open-source, AI-powered content engine** designed by creators, for creators.

## 🚀 What is OBS-Atom?

OBS-Atom is more than streaming software — it’s a **creative ecosystem**.  
We’re building the **next-generation content engine** where creators can:

- 🎥 **Stream in Vertical Mode (9:16)** optimized for mobile-first audiences  
- 🕹 **Interactive Overlays** (polls, Q&A, countdowns)  
- ✨ **AR Filters & Effects** (open-source, real-time, TikTok-level creative power)  
- 🎶 **Trending Sounds & Music** (licensed + community-driven)  
- 💎 **Monetization Built-In** (virtual gifts, affiliate links, paid interactions)  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Suggestions** (real-time filter, effect & sound recommendations)  

> This isn’t just software — it’s a movement toward **creator ownership**, **freedom**, and **future-ready innovation**.

## 🌐 Why OBS-Atom?

- **Open Source Forever:** Creators own their tools & data — no corporate algorithms.
